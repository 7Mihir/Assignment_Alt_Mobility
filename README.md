# Assignment_Alt_Mobility
This project presents a complete data analysis workflow focused on understanding customer retention trends and payment behaviors for Alt Mobility — a tech-driven vehicle leasing and asset management company.
Using SQL for data extraction and transformation, along with Python (Pandas + Matplotlib) for data visualization, we uncover key metrics related to cohort-based customer retention, payment patterns, and user purchasing behavior.
📦 MySQL — for SQL queries and cohort grouping

📊 Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) — for data wrangling and visualizations

🧮 Jupyter Notebook — for interactive analysis

📁 GitHub — for version control and collaboration

# Project Objectives
Analyze how many customers from each monthly cohort return and make repeat purchases.
Identify customer drop-off points and calculate retention rates.
Visualize cohort retention in a heatmap format.
Extract insights to support business decisions on engagement, payment optimization, and growth.
